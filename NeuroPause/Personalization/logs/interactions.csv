# - timestamp: Date and time of the interaction
# - nudge_type: Type of nudge presented to the user
# - action_taken: Action taken by the user in response to the nudge
# - feedback: User feedback on the nudge (if applicable)

# Example header:

# The file is currently empty and will be populated with interaction data during the execution of the system.
