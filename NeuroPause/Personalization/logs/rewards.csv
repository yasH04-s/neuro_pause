# rewards.csv

# This file is intended to store logs of rewards received by users based on their interactions with the nudge system.
# The expected format is as follows:
# user_id, reward_amount, timestamp
# Example:
# 1, 10, 2023-10-01 12:00:00
# 2, 5, 2023-10-01 12:05:00

# The file is currently empty and will be populated during the execution of the nudge system.
